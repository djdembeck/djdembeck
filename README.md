### About Me

I'm a passionate software engineer with 2.5 years of experience at Laxamentum Technologies. I've honed my skills in Typescript, C#, Python, and Ruby on Rails. I started my journey in tech with Bash, and I'm constantly seeking innovative solutions to complex problems.

In my spare time, I'm not just a developer, but also a dedicated volunteer at SPCA of Texas, where I've achieved the rank of "Orange" in dog handling. I find immense joy in giving back and making a positive impact on the lives of our furry friends.

I also contribute as a volunteer tester at Plex (Plex Ninja), helping test upcoming features and ensure a stable user experience.

When I'm not coding or volunteering, you'll find me enjoying quality time with my furry companion, Leah üê∂, and diving into the immersive world of audiobooks üéß.

### My Projects

Here are some of my key projects:

- [Audnexus](https://github.com/laxamentumtech/audnexus) - An audiobook data aggregation API, combining multiple sources of data into one consistent source.
- [AudiobookDB](https://audiobookdb.org/) - A user-contributed metadata database for audiobooks, built on SvelteKit.
- [Bragi Books](https://github.com/djdembeck/bragibooks) - An audiobook library cleanup and management tool.

Feel free to explore my repositories to see my coding journey unfold.
